+ Solve JSON problems in various parsers

JSON better encoding;

+ auto generate diff in tables

1)sync->
	1) use all new fields (bounds/optimized turnpoints)
	2) make all checks for synced flights -> same flight/same hash etc
	3) use the igc file that came with the zip if mode is local_insert


2) Make detectTaekoff more inteligent:
	Dont detect if takeoff distance <=takeoffRadious
	also maybe a new way of finding closeset waypoint

3) Sync pilots -> 2 ways
	2) civil id
	3) mapping table -> can be constructed by preliminary examination of flights(with hashes)/pilots between 2 servers
