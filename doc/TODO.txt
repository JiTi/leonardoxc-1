+ Solve JSON problems in various parsers

JSON better encoding;

+ auto generate diff in tables

1)sync->
	1) use all new fields (bounds/optimized turnpoints)
	2) make all checks for synced flights -> same flight/same hash etc
	3) use the igc file that came with the zip if mode is local_insert


2) Make detectTaekoff more inteligent:
	Dont detect if takeoff distance <=takeoffRadious
	also maybe a new way of finding closeset waypoint

3) Sync pilots -> 2 ways
	2) civil id
	3) mapping table -> can be constructed by preliminary examination of flights(with hashes)/pilots between 2 servers



todo

Filter on nationality
Option to xc league only on local flights

sync
1) correct dateadded
2) info on whether to propagate flight or not 
3) pilot sync mapping table

sync.php -> special pilot sync mode
 only output pilot info + flight hash for add operations
 so to have pilots that have submitted same hash igc
